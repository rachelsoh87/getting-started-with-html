    <p><b>How the Web works</b></p>
<p>The <em>World Wide Web (the Web)</em> is a collection of <em>HTML documents (web pages)</em> that have been formatted and annotated using <em>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML</em>). Web pages may contain text and links to images, videos and various other types of multimedia content.</p> 
<p>People access the Web through the internet—the world’s largest computer network where computers communicate with one another. </p>
<p>The computers that communicate using the internet are servers and our laptops (or desktops, cellphones, tablets); servers host the files that make up the Web, whereas our laptops use browsers to display files found on the Web. </p>
<p>When we want to open a link like <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">www.wikipedia.org</a>, our laptops send <em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (http)</em> requests to servers, the servers look up the requested HTML document (web page) and sends it back to the user’s laptop that uses browsers to displays the internet files.</p>

<p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b></p>
<p>HTML is used to form web pages. Web pages consist of text and other content—and markup language that determine how the text and content are displayed.</p> 
<p>HTML elements is the structure of how tags must be placed for the document to be decipherable by web browsers.</p> 


<b>Tags</b> usually have an opening tag and a closing tag.
If you don’t close your tags, everything after your opening tag will continue the command of your opening tag.
To avoid errors, you should make your closing tag as soon as you make your opening tag—unless it is a <em>void tag</em>. Void tags are tags that don’t have content, such as images. Void tags do not have a closing tag. 

<p><b>Elements</b></p>
So far, we have learnt that elements are usually either <em><b>inline elements</b></em> or <em><b>block elements</b></em>. Block elements form an invisible box, of a specific width and height, around its content. 

<p><b>Computers are literal.</b> Therefore, computers require programmers to write in a precise and exact manner for it to understand instructions.</p>

<p><b>Programmers don’t have to remember everything.</b> They can look things up as and when they need them.</p>
